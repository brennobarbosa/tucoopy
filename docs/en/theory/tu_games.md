# The cooperative game as a coalition value function

After the initial intuition about cooperation, we now need to take an important step: describe the situation precisely.

The central idea of cooperative games is surprisingly simple.

We do not model strategies.
We do not model step-by-step decisions.
We do not model sequences of moves.

We model only this:

> **how much value each possible group of players can generate when it cooperates.**

---

## Players and coalitions

Consider a finite set of players

$$
N = \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}.
$$

Any subset $S \\subseteq N$ is called a **coalition**.

This includes:

- players alone, like $\\{i\\}$,
- intermediate groups, like $\\{1,3,4\\}$,
- and the grand coalition $N$, containing everyone.

The central question becomes:

> If exactly the players in $S$ cooperate with each other, how much can they generate?

---

## The characteristic function

That question is answered by a function

$$
v : 2^N \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R},
$$

where $2^N$ is the set of all possible coalitions.

For each $S \\subseteq N$, the number $v(S)$ represents the total value the players in $S$ can generate by cooperating.

We can now write this precisely.

A (transferable-utility) cooperative game is described by a pair $(N,v)$, where

$$
v:2^N \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad v(\\emptyset)=0.
$$

This function is called the **characteristic function** (or **coalition function**) of the game.

## What does this function really mean?

Depending on the context, $v(S)$ may represent:

- profit generated by a consortium of companies,
- cost savings from sharing infrastructure,
- votes obtained by a political coalition,
- joint production capacity,
- risk reduction from acting as a group.

The essential point is that $v(S)$ measures the **total value available** to that group.

Think of $v(S)$ as the *size of the pie* available to coalition $S$. How that pie is divided comes later.

## A concrete example

Consider three companies interested in building a gas pipeline:

$$
N = \\{1,2,3\\}.
$$

Alone, none of them can make the project viable:

$$
v(\\{1\\}) = v(\\{2\\}) = v(\\{3\\}) = 0.
$$

But in pairs, they can already extract some value:

$$
v(\\{1,2\\}) = 80, \\quad
v(\\{1,3\\}) = 60, \\quad
v(\\{2,3\\}) = 70.
$$

And all three together achieve an even better outcome:

$$
v(\\{1,2,3\\}) = 100.
$$

That table **is the entire game**. Nothing else is needed.

---

## What we are *not* modeling

Notice what we left out:

- who proposed the alliance,
- who negotiated with whom,
- what the order of decisions was,
- what strategies were used.

All of that disappears.

What remains is only the **value structure of cooperation**.

---

## Why is this powerful?

Because from this function $v$ alone, we can start asking deep questions:

- How should we split $v(N)$ among the players?
- Who is essential for generating value?
- Do stable divisions exist?
- What is a fair division?
- Who has more power within the coalition structure?

All classic concepts in cooperative game theory arise exclusively from this function.

---

## An important change in perspective

In non-cooperative games, the focus is on players' behavior.

Here, the focus is on the **mathematical structure of cooperation**.

The game is not a sequence of actions.

The game is a **table of coalition values**.

And it is from that table that the whole theory is built.

---

!!! tip "A strong (and maybe invisible) assumption"
    At this point, we are assuming something very strong.

    We are assuming that if a coalition generates value $v(S)$, then that value can be divided among its members in any way they want.

    We are assuming that value is perfectly transferable.

    This is natural when we talk about money, profit, costs, or energy.

    But not every kind of cooperation produces something that can be redistributed this way.

    Sometimes cooperating does not produce "a pie to divide", but rather a set of feasible outcomes -- and some outcomes cannot be converted into others through side payments.

    When that happens, the model we are using is no longer appropriate.

    We then enter the world of non-transferable utility games.

    They exist. They matter. And they are mathematically more subtle.

    But for almost everything we want to study here -- fairness, stability, and power when value can be redistributed -- the model we are using, called transferable utility (TU), is not only sufficient, but extraordinarily expressive.
