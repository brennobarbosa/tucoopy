# TU cooperative games

Cooperative game theory studies situations where players can benefit from forming groups, or *coalitions*. A key modeling choice is whether the benefits created by a coalition can be freely redistributed among its members. This leads to the central distinction between **transferable utility (TU)** and **non-transferable utility (non-TU)** games.

This library focuses exclusively on **TU cooperative games**, which already cover a wide range of economic, engineering, and market-based applications.

## Transferable vs non-transferable utility

In a **transferable utility (TU)** game, the value generated by a coalition is measured in a common unit and can be freely transferred among its members. Once a coalition $S$ forms and generates total value $v(S)$, any division of this value among the players in $S$ is feasible.

Typical interpretations of utility in TU games include money, profit, cost savings, energy, or any other quantity that can be redistributed through side payments.

In **non-transferable utility (non-TU)** games, this assumption no longer holds. A coalition does not generate a single number, but rather a *set of feasible payoff vectors*. Players may face technological, legal, or physical constraints that limit how gains can be shared. Compensation between players may be impossible or only partially feasible.

!!! tip "Intuition"
    - TU games are about **how to split a single pie**.
    - Non-TU games are about **which payoff combinations are even possible**.

Because of these constraints, non-TU games require a richer and more complex mathematical framework, and many classic solution concepts do not apply directly or must be substantially modified.

## Why focus on TU games?

The TU assumption is not merely a simplification — in many contexts, it is a very natural modeling choice.

In markets, joint ventures, cost-sharing problems, voting systems, or network cooperation, outcomes are often ultimately evaluated in monetary or otherwise transferable terms. Even when cooperation generates non-monetary benefits, these are frequently approximated or negotiated using transfers.

Focusing on TU games allows us to:

- describe cooperation with a single scalar value per coalition,
- compare coalitions directly,
- and apply well-established solution concepts with clear interpretations.

Most importantly, TU games make it possible to ask sharp and tractable questions about **fairness**, **stability**, and **power**, which are the core themes of cooperative game theory.

## TU cooperative games

A TU cooperative game is fully characterized by its **characteristic function** $v(S)$, which assigns a real number to every possible coalition.

This abstraction deliberately ignores *how* value is created or *how* players negotiate internally. Only the final worth that each coalition can secure matters. All solution concepts studied later operate on this object.

Common conventions used throughout this library include:

- $v(\emptyset) = 0$
- Allocations are vectors $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
- **Efficiency** is expressed as
    
    $$
    \sum_{i \in N} x_i = v(N)
    $$

See also: `references.md`.

## Characteristic function

!!! note "Definition (*TU Cooperative Game*)" 
    A TU cooperative game is a pair $(N, v)$ where $N$ is a finite set of players and
    
    $$
    v : 2^N \to \mathbb{R}
    $$

    is the characteristic function satisfying $v(\emptyset) = 0$.

!!! tip "Intuition"
    $v(S)$ represents the total worth that coalition $S$ can guarantee for itself if it forms, regardless of how that worth is later divided among its members.

??? example "Example"
    Consider three players who can collaborate on a project.

    - Acting alone, each player generates value $1$.
    - Any pair generates value $3$.
    - All three together generate value $4$.

    The characteristic function summarizes this information in a compact form.  
    Cooperative game theory then studies different ways of allocating the value $4$ among the players, depending on the notion of fairness or stability one wants to adopt.

## Classes of TU cooperative games

Not all TU cooperative games have the same structure. Certain properties of the characteristic function lead to important **classes of games**, each with distinct economic interpretations and theoretical consequences.

Understanding these classes helps explain why some solution concepts behave particularly well in certain games.

### Superadditive games

!!! note "Definition"
    A TU cooperative game is **superadditive** if, for any two disjoint coalitions
    $S, T \subseteq N$ with $S \cap T = \emptyset$,
    
    $$
    v(S \cup T) \ge v(S) + v(T).
    $$

!!! tip "Intuition"
    When two disjoint coalitions merge, they do not lose value.
    
    Cooperation never hurts, and forming larger coalitions is always at least as good as staying separate.

??? example "Example"
    In many production or cost-sharing problems, combining resources leads to economies of scale, making the game naturally superadditive.

Superadditivity is often interpreted as a basic incentive for players to form larger coalitions, although it does not guarantee that the grand coalition will be stable.

### Convex games (supermodular games)

!!! note "Definition"
    A TU cooperative game is **convex** if for all coalitions $S, T \subseteq N$,
    
    $$
    v(S \cup T) + v(S \cap T) \ge v(S) + v(T).
    $$

!!! tip "Intuition"
    Convexity captures **increasing marginal contributions**.
    
    A player tends to contribute more when joining a larger coalition than when joining a smaller one.

??? example "Example"
    In network or infrastructure problems, an additional participant often becomes more valuable as the network grows, leading to convex games.

Convex games have particularly strong properties: many classical solution concepts coincide or enjoy appealing fairness and stability guarantees.

### Additive games

!!! note "Definition"
    A TU cooperative game is **additive** if
    
    $$
    v(S) = \sum_{i \in S} v(\{i\})
    \quad \text{for all } S \subseteq N.
    $$

!!! tip "Intuition"
    There are no interaction effects. Players neither help nor hinder each other — cooperation simply aggregates individual contributions.

??? example "Example"
    If each player brings an independent, fixed contribution to a project, the game is additive.

Additive games are simple but useful as benchmarks and sanity checks.

### Simple games

!!! note "Definition"
    A **simple game** is a TU cooperative game where
    $$
    v(S) \in \{0, 1\}
    $$
    for all coalitions $S$.

!!! tip "Intuition"
    Coalitions are either **winning** or **losing**.
    
    Only the ability to achieve a goal matters, not the size of the payoff.

??? example "Example"
    Voting systems are classic examples of simple games: a coalition either has enough votes to pass a motion or it does not.

Simple games are especially relevant for studying power indices such as the Banzhaf or Shapley–Shubik index.

---

### Weighted voting games

!!! note "Definition"
    A simple game is a **weighted voting game** if there exist weights $w_i \ge 0$ and a quota $q$ such that
    $$
    v(S) = 1 \quad \text{iff} \quad \sum_{i \in S} w_i \ge q.
    $$

!!! tip "Intuition"
    Each player has voting weight, and a proposal passes once enough weight is gathered.

??? example "Example"
    Shareholder voting, parliamentary systems, and council voting rules are often modeled as weighted voting games.

Weighted voting games provide a concrete link between cooperative game theory and institutional design.
